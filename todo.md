# Todo

A non-sorted list of things that can and/or should be developed further

* Add support for tellstick classic (beta-testers needed)
* Add support for more devices (protocols) (beta-testers needed)
* Outgoing message repetition
* Better handling of sent message ack (timeout etc)
* Handling of MQTT server disconnect
* MQTT server login (username/password)
* Encryption of MQTT connection
* Publish to pypi
* Filtering of repeated inputs (e.g the remote control sends each command 
  3 times, that should be filtered to only one mqtt message)
